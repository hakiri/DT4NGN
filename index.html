    <h2>IEEE DT4NGN 2024</h2>
    <p>
        Digital twins, which are a virtual representation of real-world physical 
        entities, have received significant interest from both the research and 
        industrial communities. Initially, the concept of twins was introduced 
        by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
        Apollo program in the 1970s, where virtual replicas of space vehicles on 
        Earth were built to mirror the condition of the equipment during the mission. 
        Then, the concept of Digital Twin was introduced to John Vickers by 
        Michael Grieves in the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) as a virtual 
        instance (twin) of a physical system.

    <!--  <h2>Camera-ready Instructions</h2>
    <h3>LaTeX Instructions</h3>
    <p>
    <h4>Template:</h4> Please use the sigconf proceedings template from the ACM Master article template for LaTeX (acmart class) for
    your submission (under the LaTeX Authors section). Please follow the instructions given on the page, and please have a
    look / start from the sample file “sample-sigconf.tex” in the acmart package. Even if you have already downloaded the
    package for another conference, you should download it again as ACM often makes changes to their template and publishes
    new versions. If you submit a paper using an outdated version of the template, you might be required to update to a
    newer version.</p>
    <p>
    <h4>Fonts:</h4>     Type 1 or TrueType fonts must be used (this will usually happen by default). Type 3 fonts are not permitted.
    TrueType fonts are permitted, but will be tested for any problems which may need to be rectified. For help on obtaining
    the correct type of fonts, see this hint in the ACM FAQ list. Note: in rare cases, PDFs generated with pdflatex will not
    contain embedded fonts. This most often occurs when vector images included in paper do not themselves embed their fonts.
    If we find problems with your PDF, and you are unable to submit a revised version with correctly embedded fonts, we may
    have to take a less desirable and less safe route: that you submit a PostScript (PS) version, from which we produce PDF.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h4>Camera-ready copyright header: </h4>
    the ACM copyright form will provide a block of LaTeX code to be included in the “Rights
    management information” section of the header. Please double-check that your produced document matches the copyright
    info details found in HotCrp, and that you have included your full DOI URL.

    <!-- <span style="color:black; font-size:18px"> Title: Machine Learning in Digital Twin Edge Networks </span>
    <p>In this talk, we mainly introduce our proposed new research
        direction: Digital Twin Edge Networks (DITEN). We first present the
        concept and model related to Digital Twin (DT) and DITEN. Then, we
        focus on new research challenges and results when machine learning
        is exploited in DITEN, including federated learing, deep
        reinforcement learning and transfer learning. DT building, DT
        placement and DT transfer as unique research questions, will be
        defined and analyzed. We are also expecting that the talk will help
        the audience understand the future development of edge computing,
        e.g., digital twin edge networks in the context of Metaverse.</p>
